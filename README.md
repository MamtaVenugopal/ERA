# ERA S6
This is the assignment given in 5th Session, ERA batch of School of AI
# Classification of MNIST Dataset
In this session, the MNIST dataset has been used. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing image.
It is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
It has all the same square size images of 28×28 pixels, and they are of grayscale.
