# ERA S7
Objective of this assignment
1. 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
2. Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
3. Less than 8000 Parameters
4. Modular code
5. Analysis in exactly 3 steps  "target, result, analysis" 

# Classification of MNIST Dataset
In this session, the MNIST dataset has been used. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing image.
It is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
It has all the same square size images of 28×28 pixels, and they are of grayscale.

### Target
1. Modularise the model
2. First network created with lowest parameters possible with convolution layers, gap average pooling
3. Plot the accuracy Metrics
4. Reach a receptive field of 20

### Result
Parameters : 1622
Best Train Accuracy: 89.19%
Best Test Accuracy: 92.29%
### Analysis
The model is underfitting as it has not reached 90% accuracy. The test accuracy is higher than the train accuracy. 
Adding more parameters is the next strategy to increase the training accuracy to 90%
