# ERA S10 - Classification of CIFAR10
This is the assignment given in 10th Session, ERA batch of School of AI

In this session, the CIFAR10 dataset has been used. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing image.
It is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
It has all the same square size images of 32X32 pixels, and they are colored images.

## S10.ipynb 
This juputer notebook is the main program from where all other files like utils.py and models.py are called from. 
Code is written for classification of CIFAR10 dataset using pytorch. PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep 
learning models, which is a type of machine learning that's commonly used in applications like image recognition and 
language processing. Model optimization used in this notebook Adam.  
Resnet like model used
1. PrepLayer - Conv 3x3 s1, p1) >> BN >> RELU [64k]
2. Layer1 -
   X = Conv 3x3 (s1, p1) >> MaxPool2D >> BN >> RELU [128k]
